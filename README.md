# Customer Behavior Prediction using Naive Bayes

## Model Creation

- Import necessary libraries, including scikit-learn for machine learning and data manipulation tools.
- Load the customer behavior dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if needed, and splitting it into features (X) and target variable (y).
- Import the Naive Bayes model from scikit-learn, such as `MultinomialNB` for discrete features or `GaussianNB` for continuous features.
- Create an instance of the Naive Bayes model.

## Training the Model

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using tools like `train_test_split`.
- Train the Naive Bayes model on the training data using the `fit` method, providing the features (`X_train`) and the corresponding labels (`y_train`).

## Testing the Model

- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics like accuracy and error rate.
- Use scikit-learn functions like `accuracy_score` for comprehensive performance evaluation.

## Prediction

- Make predictions on new or unseen data using the trained Naive Bayes model. This is done with the `predict` method, providing the features of the new data.

## Visualization on Customer Behavior Dataset

- Visualize key insights from the dataset using plots and graphs:
  - Plot the distribution of the target variable (customer behavior) to understand the class distribution.
  - Create visualizations, such as   pie charts, to represent categorical features.
  - Visualize the model's performance metrics using confusion matrices 

Adapt the provided code and visualizations based on the specific characteristics of your customer behavior dataset and the requirements of your analysis.
